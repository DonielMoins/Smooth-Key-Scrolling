## License

<!-- TODO Find correct license -->
> TODO

## Open Source

Yes, please read the license file for more details.

Although some aspects of the extension are hidden behind a paywall, the extension is made completely open source.

Such as that if anyone has the technical ability to, they can easily disable the paywall, but such a paywall is only made to find some source of funding/support.

Please keep in mind that I'm currently a broke student, so if you can afford it, consider buying a full license or donating any amount you feel comfortable with.
